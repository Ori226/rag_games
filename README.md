# rag_games

This repository contains simple games. The latest addition is a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Tic-Tac-Toe

The game files now live under `docs/tictactoe` so they can be hosted directly with
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages).
If Pages is enabled for this repository with the **docs** folder as the source,
you can play at:

```
https://<USER>.github.io/<REPOSITORY>/tictactoe/
```

Replace `<USER>` and `<REPOSITORY>` with your GitHub username and repository
name. You can also open `docs/tictactoe/index.html` locally in any browser if
you prefer to play without Pages.
